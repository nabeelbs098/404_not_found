# **App Name**: EmotiScroll

## Core Features:

- Homepage: Landing page with a brief explanation of the concept.
- Emotion Detection: Webcam emotion recognition using AI to analyze user's facial expressions.
- Emotion Prompts: Sequential emotion challenges, each prompting the user to mimic a specific emotion.
- Emotion Matching: Real-time feedback, where a tool assesses if the user's expression matches the target emotion.
- Interactive Story: Story snippets, with background effects triggered by the current target emotion (e.g., emoji rain for happiness).
- Emotion-Controlled Scrolling: Page scrolling that only occurs when the correct emotion is mimicked and recognized.
- Completion Page: Celebratory congratulations page upon successful completion of all emotion challenges.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), a calming and slightly mysterious color to evoke a sense of emotional exploration. The exploration suggested by the project lead us to prefer an exploratory color like purple.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0), providing a neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the emotions being displayed and detected.
- Accent color: Muted pink (#D8BFD8), to add a touch of warmth without overpowering the design; analogous to lavender, with slightly different brightness/saturation.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, to offer a balance of approachability and legibility.
- Use simple, expressive icons related to emotions to enhance user understanding (e.g., smiling face for 'happy').
- Clean and intuitive layout to focus the user's attention on the emotion prompts and the webcam feed.
- Subtle, emotion-based animations (e.g., gentle swaying or shimmering) for feedback and immersion.
