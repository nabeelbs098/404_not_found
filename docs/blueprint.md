## Core Features:

- Introduction Page: Landing page with a brief explanation of the website and how to use it, with a clear call-to-action to start the emotion-mimicking journey.
- Emotion Recognition: Emotion detection through webcam feed; uses a tool that processes the user's facial expressions to determine if it matches the target emotion.
- Narrative Progression: Progressive story-telling; the story unfolds gradually with each correctly mimicked emotion. 
- Emotion Prompt: Target emotion indicator; prominently displays the emotion the user needs to mimic on each page.
- Visual Feedback: Emotion-themed visual effects (emoji rain, color filters, etc.) triggered upon correctly mimicking the emotion, offering immediate positive feedback.
- Completion Page: Congratulatory end-page shown after successful completion of all emotion challenges, offering a satisfying conclusion.

## Style Guidelines:

- Accent color: A warm, energetic orange (#E0B060) used for highlighting interactive elements and indicating emotional successes.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for body text, lending a storytelling, narrative feel, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for headers and UI elements, providing clarity and modernity.
- Emotion-based icons: Custom icons for each emotion that guide the user without text labels, with clear visual metaphors.
- Fluid transitions between pages and subtle animations accompanying successful emotion recognition to immerse the user in a fluid, responsive emotional journey.
